## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Just download the `.sh` script or `git clone` the repo.

## ðŸ§­ Steps to Create the Custom Command


1. **Create the `bin` Directory**  
   Create a folder called `bin` in `~/.local/share/`. If it already exists, simply add the `quote.sh` script there and rename it to `quote` (removing the `.sh` extension).

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bin
   cp /path/to/quote.sh ~/.local/share/bin/quote
   ```

1. **Make `quote` executable**  
   Give the `quote` permissions to run.

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.local/share/bin/quote
   ```

**Update Your Shell Configuration:**
Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/bin:$PATH"
```

**Reload Your Terminal:**
Run the following command to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
**or**

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
